Hello everybody, welcome back to the last video of the last
module of this course. In this module, we're still unleashing our
confidence intervals. We're going to look at the exponential
distribution again, and we're going to come up with a confidence interval for
the rate parameter Lambda. In the last video, we used
the sample mean x-bar. But sometimes you have
to use what you have. In statistics you can either
look up a formula in a book, on the Internet, or
you can create one yourself and not be bound
by what you can find. Here is the setup. Suppose that I have a random
sample of size n from the exponential distribution
with rate Lambda, and suppose that I
want to construct a 95 percent confidence interval based on the minimum
of the distribution. Why? Because in this case,
this is all we have. Before we go into our
step 1, step 2, step 3, and step 4, we want
to figure out what the distribution of a
minimum looks like. Suppose I have a
random sample of size n from this exponential
distribution. That means that I
have some values here and here, and
here, and here, and here, and here,1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, so n is 6 in this case. The minimum of the
sample is over here. Let's look at a second
sample of size 6. I have something here and here, and here, and here, and here, and here. The minimum in this case
is right over here. In both cases, I found a minimum, and if I got another sample, I'd find another minimum and another sample, another minimum. The minimums are going to
tend to be closer to 0. Then the regular sampled values, it's going to be really hard to get a minimum all
the way up here. It has its own distribution. It's some distribution
that has more of its mass or area or probability
stuck down by 0. Let's try to find
the distribution. For some notation. I'm going to let Y_n be the minimum of my
random sample of size n. The CDF for each of the individual Xs is 1 minus e to the minus Lambda X because that's the CDF for the
exponential distribution. I'm going to go for the
CDF of the minimum, why? Because it's a continuous
random variable and the PDF doesn't really
represent probability. It's usually easier
to look at a CDF, and is especially
so in the case of finding the distribution
of a minimum or a maximum. The CDF for Y_n looks like this, and I'm going to
plug in what Y_n is. Now the goal is going
to be to rewrite this probability in terms
of the individual Xs. Because I know something
about the individual Xs, I know their distribution. Let's take a look at what
it means for the minimum of a sample to be less than or
equal to some fixed number y. Here's a number y
on a number line. Here's a random sample of size 3, such that the minimum is
less than or equal to y. But here is another
sample of size three, such that the minimum is
less than or equal to y. Here's still is another
random sample of size 3 such that the minimum is
less than or equal to y. There are a lot of ways
for the XS to fall so that the minimum is
less than or equal to y. It's going to be
hard to translate this statement about the
minimum to a statement involving where the
individual Xs fall with respect to this
fixed number y. But not, if we look at the
complement of this event. The minimum in a sample is
greater than a fixed number y, if and only if every
number in the sample is greater than y. I don't
care exactly where they are, but I do know they're
all greater than y. In order for the minimum
to be greater than y. That means I get to rewrite
this line as 1 minus the probability that
X_1 is greater than y and X_2 is greater than y, and up to X_n is greater than y. Now by independence,
I get to break this probability up into a
product of probabilities. By identicalness, these
probabilities are all the same. I get one of them raised
to the nth power. Now, this is a tail probability for the exponential distribution. The probability that X_1
is greater than x is 1 minus the probability it's
less than or equal to X. In other words, 1 minus the CDF. I'm going to plug that
in. Here's where we are. I'm going to plug in the actual
CDF for the exponential. Do a little simplification. Do a little more simplification. When you raise something to a power and then up
to another power, you get to multiply the powers, so this leaves us with 1 minus
e to the minus n Lambda y, which we recognize as the CDF of an exponential
distribution because we just wrote it down. But if you don't take the derivative and you'll
recognize this as the PDF of an exponential with
parameter n times Lambda. Here is a generic picture of an exponential distribution
with rate Lambda. When you plug in zero, it starts at Lambda and then
goes down exponentially, so n times Lambda, where n is your sample size
is going to be larger. It's going to be higher
up on the y-axis. A pdf starting there
has to come down a lot faster because the total area under the curve has to be one. Now we're starting
so much higher. This means that the bilk of the area for the blue curve that I've graphed is much
closer to zero, than the bulk of the area
for the original curve. That's what we expected. We didn't necessarily expect that the minimum has an exponential
distribution itself. But we did expect the bulk of the area to move
down towards zero. In fact, we got an exponential distribution
with a higher rate. We're ready to develop our confidence interval for
Lambda based on the minimum. Got a random sample of size n from this exponential
distribution. I want a 95 percent
confidence interval for Lambda based on the minimum
value of the sample. Again, you might care about this if that's the data
you have measured. You have to work with
what you're given. If we're only given a minimum
and not a sample mean, then this is what
you'd have to do. Step 1 is to choose a statistic. In this case, it's
been chosen for us. It's that minimum. Step 2
is to find a function of the statistic whose
distribution is known to us and unknown
parameter free. We just showed that
the distribution of the minimum is exponential
with rate and Lambda. We can figure out the distribution of a constant
times an exponential. Or you can realize that we
already know what this is. Because such an exponential
distribution is really a Gamma distribution with
first parameter being one, second parameter matching
that of the exponential. In the last video,
we talked about what you get when you multiply
a Gamma times a constant. We don't have to
go back and figure this out for the exponential, because the exponential
is a particular Gamma. I want to get rid of the
Lambda and while I'm at it, let's get rid of the end to make this whole thing a lot easier. If I multiply the minimum, the y n by n times Lambda. That ends up under the second parameter in
the Gamma distribution, which gives us a Gamma 1,1 and translating back
to the exponential, an exponential with rate 1. For step 3, I want to find the appropriate critical values. Here is a so-called
pivotal quantity. It's a quantity made of a
statistic based on the data and the unknown parameter whose
distribution is known to us and not dependent on
any unknown parameters. You might think I'm going to
go to r here, but I'm not, because the exponential
distribution is so easy to work with. I want to integrate the exponential rate
1 distribution up to some number that gives me
area 0.95 to the left. Or I could be going
in the middle and putting half of the 5
percent area on both sides. Or I could be going from
some number up to infinity. But let's go with this one. To find this number which
I'm calling question mark, I need to integrate the
exponential rate 1 pdf from zero up to this question mark
and set that equal to 0.95. Now, this integral is 1 minus e to the
minus question mark. If you set that equal to 0.95 and solve for
the question mark, you get the negative of
the natural log of 0.05. Now, the log of numbers between zero and 1 gives
you negative values. Fortunately, this makes sense
and is a positive value. Step 3 is to find our critical values and
that's what we just did. We know that n times Lambda times the minimum value in the sample is
exponential with rate 1, and we know that we can capture 95 percent of the area for this distribution
between the number 0 and the number
negative log of 0.05. I'm going to put the
pivotal quantity between those numbers and solve
for Lambda in the middle. In this case, I'm going to divide through by n times the minimum. n is a sample size. Y is a minimum of exponentials
which is not negative, so there's no negatives, so nothing is going to flip. We end up with a
confidence interval. In this case, 0 on the left and the negative log of 0.05 divided by n times that minimum
on the right. We did it. That is the last video of the
last module of this course. That was pretty intense because in constructing
our confidence interval, we use skills from
all over the course. If you understood
what we did, great. But if not, don't
worry, you'll get it. It takes some time to
sink in and so take a little time before you go on to take the
final for this course. Then you can go forth into
the world and estimate. Hopefully, I will see
you in another course in the near future. Click.
