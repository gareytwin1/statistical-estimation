Welcome back, everyone.
In this video, we're going to truly talk
about confidence intervals unleashed. What does that mean? So far, all of our
confidence intervals are things you can look up in
books or on the Internet, but what if you truly had
to construct your own? Not everything is normal. We're just going to
do this by example. Suppose that I have a
random sample of size n from the exponential
distribution with rate Lambda and suppose
that I want to build a 95 percent or any percent confidence
interval for Lambda. The first step is always
to choose a statistic, and this is one that you need
to be able to work with. You need to be able to
compute a function of that statistic and the
thing you're estimating, whose distribution is known to you and is unknown
parameter-free. This quantity that
we keep making is known in statistics as
a pivotal quantity. Let's try the sample mean because we know a lot of things about the sample mean. Given we have an
exponential distribution, what is the distribution
of the sample mean? Well, we do know that the sum of exponentials has a
Gamma distribution, where the first parameter is
the number we added together and the second parameter matches that of the original
exponentials. We did see way back in
the first module that if you take a Gamma
random variable and you multiply by a
positive constant, you still get a
Gamma distribution. It's just that, that
constant ends up underneath the second parameter. This is only true
if you parameterize the Gamma distribution as we have been doing
in this course. Be careful if you're looking at other books or on the Internet, the constant might end up in front of the second parameter. The sample mean is just the
sum with a constant in front, the constant being one over n, and if we put one over n
underneath the second parameter, we end up with a Gamma
distribution with parameters n and nLambda. That is starting with an exponential distribution
with rate Lambda. If we take the sample mean
of NIID random variables, we get a Gamma with
parameters n and nLambda. The second step is always to find a function of the thing we're trying to estimate and the
statistic we're using, whose distribution is known to us an unknown parameter-free. Why? Because if we
know its distribution, we can put it between two
critical values that capture the right area and if those critical values don't depend on the unknown parameter, then it will be easy for
us to take our quantity in the middle and solve for
the unknown parameter. We have X bar, which has a Gamma distribution with parameters n and nLambda, and given the
discussion we just had, if we want to get rid of the
unknown parameter Lambda, we can multiply by Lambda and
that will end up dividing the second parameter in the Gamma distribution so that Lambda times
the sample mean, is Gamma distributed
with parameters n and n. This could be our
pivotal quantity. The statistic that we put between critical values and then solve
for Lambda in the middle. How could you get critical values for the Gamma and n distribution? You can get them using R
like we have all along. You can use the
command Q Gamma and put in the areas that you
want to capture to the right, and then the two parameters
for the Gamma distribution, the n and the n where these are actual fixed numbers that you have a sum fixed size
n. Historically, people had to do
numerical integrals and this was a lot of work and
they would consult tables, but because the Gamma
distribution has two parameters, we would have to set up quite a few tables that
would correspond to each of the two parameters and all
of the different areas that we wanted to capture and
that is a lot of work. Historically, people transformed Gamma random
variables into chi-squareds. We're going to do that as well, because even though we can get the Gamma critical
values using software, there are plenty of
reasons going forward. If you take any more courses in statistics past this course, there are plenty
of reasons you're going to be wanting to be able to convert Gamma random
variables to chi-squareds. It's an important skill
for so many things. Let's do it. I'm going to start
from the beginning again, for my confidence interval. Suppose we have a random
sample of size n from the exponential distribution
with rate Lambda, we're going to construct a 95 percent confidence interval. Our first step is always
to choose a statistic, so I'm going to choose the
sample mean because we know a lot about sample
means, and step 2, is to look at the distribution of the statistic and
maybe adjust it to get a pivotal quantity
whose distribution is known to us an
unknown parameter-free. We saw that our sample mean has a Gamma distribution with
parameters n and nLambda, and if we multiply by Lambda, we get a Gamma distribution
with parameters n and n, and I want to turn this
into a chi-squared. I like that second
parameter to be a one half. I'm going to multiply
through by n again so that it divides the second parameter and
I get a one and also, multiply through at
the same time by two, so it divides the second
parameter and we get a one half. We're really close to a
chi-squared distribution now. A chi-square n distribution
is defined to be a Gamma distribution with parameters n over 2 and one half. I don't have n over 2 but
I do have 2_n over 2, which means that we've got a chi-square distribution
with 2_n degrees of freedom. I've got a statistic and
I know it's distribution, and that distribution is
unknown parameter-free, so we're going to find the
appropriate critical values. We're going to look at the
chi-squared distribution with 2_n degrees of freedom, and for our 95 percent
confidence interval, I'm going to put area of 0.95 in the middle with area
0.025 in each tail. We've talked before for this specific distribution
about starting from zero, and putting area 0.05
in the upper tail or starting at a number that, going all the way up to infinity, gives us 0.05 in the lower tail. Here I'm just going to stick with one confidence interval. I'm going to put
0.025 in both tails. These are chi-squared
critical values, you know how to look them up, so let us put our statistic between these two
chi-squared critical values, that cutoff area 0.025 in the upper tail and 0.025
in the lower tail, which means that lower
critical value actually has area point 0.975 above it. I can solve for Lambda
in the middle and we get a chi-squared critical value divided by 2_n times
the sample mean, and another chi-squared
critical value divided by 2 times n times
the sample mean. These two endpoints here are the endpoints of our
confidence interval. I'm going to leave off
a numerical example in this case, but presumably, you have a sample size and
you have a sample mean, and you know how to look up these critical values because
we've done this many times. You've got two actual numbers that capture the
Lambda in the middle. Now, the numbers are either
going to capture it or not, but by construction
based on the sample, if you took another
sample and got a new confidence interval and another one and a new
confidence interval, and did it again, and
again, and again, 95 percent of those samples are going to give you a
confidence interval that correctly captures Lambda
95 percent of the time. That was fun, but
that's not all there is to confidence
intervals unleashed. We worked with the sample
mean because we're really familiar
with sample means, but in practice, you have
to work with what you have. Let's suppose we're given a different statistic that
we have to work with, in our last video of this
last module of this course, we're going to unleash more? I don't know. We're
going to look at the same confidence interval based on a different statistic
just because we can. I will see you in the next one.
